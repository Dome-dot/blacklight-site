        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Blacklight delivers results where others fail. We operate with disciplined planning, clear command, and decisive action. Our scope covers convoy and asset protection, high‑risk extractions, targeted strike missions, and station defense. Contracts are scoped with measurable objectives and strict timelines.</p>
        <p>Training integrates small‑unit tactics, aerospace coordination, and intelligence‑driven planning. Teams rehearse comms, approach, breach, and extract. The standard: calm under pressure, concise communication, and movement with purpose.</p>

        <h2>Manifesto</h2>
        <p>We do not posture. We prepare. We move with discipline and finish the job. When corporations delay and fleets withdraw, <strong>we advance</strong>. Discipline before glory. Mission before self. Success before excuses.</p>
        <p>Blacklight exists to create certainty in uncertain spaces. We operate with professionalism, respect, and control. That is the standard.</p>

        <h2>History of the Blacklight Interstellar Group</h2>
        <p>The Blacklight Interstellar Group was born in the shadows of conflict, forged by veterans who had seen too many campaigns lost to poor leadership and politics. What began as a coalition of former special operations soldiers, naval officers, and tactical advisors soon grew into a disciplined private military company with a singular mission: to succeed where others cannot.</p><p>Operating beyond the limits of conventional forces, Blacklight quickly earned its reputation across the galaxy as a unit that delivers results under impossible conditions. From escorting high‑value convoys through pirate‑infested sectors, to rapid‑response extractions on hostile worlds, Blacklight established itself as the reliable choice for governments, corporations, and private clients who required absolute discretion and effectiveness.</p><p>Every operative is trained by specialists drawn from diverse military traditions – ground assault, aerospace combat, reconnaissance, and advanced security doctrine. This melting pot of experience became the foundation of the Blacklight ethos: precision, discretion, and dominance.</p><p>Today, Blacklight stands as one of the most respected interstellar PMCs. While others retreat in the face of overwhelming odds, Blacklight moves forward. Where uncertainty reigns, Blacklight brings clarity. And where failure is not an option, Blacklight ensures mission success.
